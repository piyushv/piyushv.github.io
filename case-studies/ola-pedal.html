      <div class="case-study-content">
        <p>Ola, the ride-sharing company from India, launched its dockless cycle sharing service called Ola Pedal. Here I take you through the journey of designing Pedal.</p>

        <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
        <p>People have to spend a lot of time walking inside campuses and around offices as transport may or may not be available. As <strong>shared cycle</strong> services are on the rise, we wanted to <strong>test</strong> if our users are willing to <strong>use</strong> them and <strong>pay</strong> for them.</p>

        <h2>Research</h2>
        <p>I started with <strong>secondary research</strong> and <strong>competitor analyses</strong> of various cycle-sharing companies to understand the models they follow and the features they provide. After this, I did <strong>Gorilla Testing</strong> by questioning people at nearby college campuses and in our business park. Key findings:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The majority of people travel short distances by <strong>walking</strong>, some use a <strong>car</strong> or a <strong>shuttle</strong> service.</li>
          <li>People are motivated to walk as they see it as a form of <strong>exercise</strong> — it saves time by avoiding parking and waiting for transport.</li>
          <li><strong>Pain points</strong> of users who tried cycle sharing: returning cycles to a dock, depositing a security fee, and making a pass.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Scope</h2>
        <p>After considering all initial user feedback, we decided to try a <strong>dockless cycle sharing</strong> service. Riders can pick and drop cycles <strong>anywhere</strong> on the street rather than at a fixed station, offering extreme flexibility and saving the expenses of renting a parking space. We divided the Pedal launch into two phases: Pilot and MVP.</p>

        <div class="phase-section">
          <h3>Phase 1 — Pilot</h3>
          <p>We tested our dockless cycle sharing system with <strong>500 cycles</strong> at a college campus in India. We used cheap and readily available <strong>manual locks</strong> instead of automatic GPS locks (which would take ~2 months to ship), enabling a quick pilot launch.</p>
          <p><strong>Challenge:</strong> No map since cycles had no GPS, so we designed a new flow without one. Created as a Web View for Android and iOS for faster launch. Turnaround time for design was <strong>five days</strong>, including user research.</p>
          <p>I created multiple sketches to define the basic flow and layout, then iterated keeping it easy to code and in line with Ola style guidelines.</p>

          <p>For the in-ride screen, the unlock pin is displayed prominently for the first 15 minutes (which are free). After 15 minutes, a timer shows ride duration alongside the fare for transparency.</p>

          <div class="results-grid" style="margin-top: 1.5rem;">
            <div class="result-item">
              <span class="result-number">1,500</span>
              <span class="result-label">Rides per day from just 500 cycles</span>
            </div>
          </div>
          <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">This proved our hypothesis that people take cycle rides and are willing to pay for them.</p>

        <div class="phase-section">
          <h3>Phase 2 — MVP</h3>
          <p>We got 3,000 more cycles with app-based <strong>GPS locks</strong> on campuses and offices. Pedal was integrated into the Android and iOS Ola app. User testing from Phase 1 suggested users had trouble understanding the steps, so we added <strong>timely pop-ups and illustrations</strong> to help during the booking experience.</p>
          <p>Cycles are now shown on the map to display nearby availability. A cycle illustration was added on the booking screen to make it easier for the user to find the cycle number.</p>
