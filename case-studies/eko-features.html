      <h1>Business Communication for Amity (Formerly Eko)</h1>

      <div class="case-study-content">
        <p>In this case study, we delve into the detailed process of designing and enhancing key features for Eko, an internal communication and operations platform. My role as a Product Designer involved designing solutions for complex user needs and evolving business requirements for both iOS and Android apps.</p>

        <h2>1. Workflow Redesign</h2>

        <h3>Objective and Scope</h3>
        <p>Transforming Eko's Workflow feature to handle complex organizational processes while maintaining simplicity and user friendliness.</p>

        <h3>Research</h3>
        <p>We started by analysing customer feedback and competitor benchmarks, which led to identifying key areas for improvement.</p>

        </figure>

        <h3>The Problems</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>The original workflow design was limited to a single form, inadequate for intricate processes like performance reviews where we need to share different forms to different users.</li>
          <li>Absence of <strong>recurring</strong> and <strong>scheduling</strong> features led to inefficiencies.</li>
          <li>Users were requesting a <strong>custom title</strong> so they can add details like room number or specify the exact issue.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Users</h3>
        <p><strong>Front line workers (43%)</strong> and <strong>knowledge workers (34%)</strong> create and send the workflows to the <strong>23% managers or HRs</strong>. Front line workers don't have access to computers, so the design was made mobile-first.</p>

        <h3>Design</h3>
        <p>The redesign of the flow was done in three parts: Home screen, Workflow creation, and Workflow details.</p>

        <div class="phase-section">
          <h3>Home</h3>
          <p>Redesigned the home screen to surface relevant workflows and quick actions for front line workers.</p>

        <div class="phase-section">
          <h3>Creation</h3>

          </figure>
          <p>Workflow templates are made through the Admin panel. We added saved <strong>drafts</strong> and <strong>scheduled</strong> workflows to avoid duplicate workflows.</p>

          <p>In the workflow input screen, <strong>schedule</strong> and <strong>priority</strong> were added.</p>

          </figure>
        </div>

        <div class="phase-section">
          <h3>Workflow Details</h3>
          <p>The most significant improvement was adding multiple stages to a workflow, which could now handle complex processes. It has two parts — <strong>details</strong> with redesigned statuses and <strong>timeline</strong>, including past and ongoing stages. The "Awaiting your action" stage is prominently placed at the bottom.</p>

            </div>
          </div>

        <h3>Credits & My Role</h3>
        <p>I was working as a <strong>Product Designer</strong> on iOS and Android App, along with a PM, Researcher, and getting feedback from other designers. Another UX designer did web design.</p>

        <h2>2. Voice and Video Call Redesign (Android & iOS)</h2>
        <p>The redesign aimed to address identified user issues: lack of app recognition during calls, inability to switch between call types, and adherence to platform-specific guidelines.</p>

        <h3>Problems & Objectives</h3>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Brand Recognition:</strong> Users were unable to identify Eko as the source of incoming calls.</li>
          <li><strong>Functionality Limitation:</strong> The inability to switch between audio and video calls during a conversation was a significant limitation.</li>
          <li><strong>Platform Compliance:</strong> The need to integrate Apple's CallKit for iOS to align with Human Interface Guidelines.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Old Design</h3>
        <p>All screens were collected to visualise the existing flow and identify improvements.</p>

        </figure>

        <h3>New Design</h3>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Brand Integration:</strong> We incorporated the Eko logo and a clear "Eko call" notification on the incoming call screen so users immediately recognized the source of the call.</li>
          <li><strong>Enhanced Call Flexibility:</strong> Added a button to seamlessly switch between audio and video modes.</li>
          <li><strong>Platform-Specific Adjustments:</strong> For iOS, a Gaussian blur background was introduced, aligning with iOS aesthetics. For Android, a dark background was implemented for a comfortable viewing experience.</li>
          <li><strong>UI Enhancements:</strong> A dedicated bar in the Recents page allowed users to easily return to ongoing calls. An indicator on user avatars was added to signify active calls.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>3. Reply-to Feature (Android & iOS)</h2>
        <p>This section outlines the design process and implementation of the "Reply-to" feature in Eko's chat application for both Android and iOS platforms.</p>

        <h3>Process</h3>
        <p>We started by identifying all the types of messages in our app: <strong>text, voice, image, video, file</strong> and <strong>sticker</strong>. To ensure our solution was competitive, we conducted an in-depth analysis of similar features in other leading apps.</p>
        <figure class="case-study-image">
          <img src="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*agdyXQuoWcdH1SW080UreA.png" alt="Competitor analysis for reply-to feature">
        </figure>
        <p>The project had a quick turnaround time of 2 weeks.</p>

        <h3>Design</h3>
        <p>The central challenge was to create a user interface that seamlessly accommodates replies to diverse message types. The design needed to be intuitive, minimizing user effort while maintaining clarity in threaded conversations.</p>

        <h3>Credits & My Role</h3>
        <p>I made the UX/UI design for iOS and Android app, working with the Head of Design at Eko. Another designer did web design.</p>
