      <div class="case-study-content">
        <p>With platforms such as Facebook Live, Periscope, Kuaishou, Douyu, bilibili and Twitch, live streaming was on the rise. We started doing livestreams in Pomelo for monthly campaigns such as 9.9 and 11.11 and new collection launches. While live streaming had proven successful in terms of conversion and revenue, there was always room for improvement.</p>
        <p>This case study explores the enhancements made to Pomelo's live streaming feature, focusing on increasing user engagement and streamlining the shopping experience.</p>

        <h2>Research</h2>
        <p><strong>Market Analysis:</strong> A thorough secondary research and competitor analysis were conducted, focusing on popular live streaming platforms, particularly those in the SEA e-commerce landscape.</p>

        </figure>
        <p><strong>User Feedback:</strong> Direct customer feedback, captured through live stream chat and Net Promoter Score (NPS) comments, provided valuable insights into user needs and preferences.</p>

        <h2>The Problems / Opportunity Areas</h2>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>User Interaction:</strong> Users frequently inquired about purchasing items showcased during the live stream, indicating a need for a more integrated shopping experience.</li>
          <li><strong>User Engagement:</strong> A noticeable user drop-off during live streams highlighted the need for more engaging content.</li>
          <li><strong>Brand Collaboration:</strong> The necessity to display third-party brand logos during collaborations.</li>
          <li><strong>Communication:</strong> Effective ways to disseminate announcements, such as delays, by the PR team.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Target Audience</h2>
        <p>The primary audience for our live streams includes women aged 20–35. Additionally, our PR team, responsible for conducting the live streams, forms a crucial part of the livestream user base.</p>

        <h2>Design</h2>
        <p>The design was done in 2 phases: usability improvements and increasing engagement.</p>

        <div class="phase-section">
          <h3>Phase 1: Usability Improvements</h3>
          <p>The main improvement was adding a simple label for the shop button to improve conversion. We also added a <strong>pinned message</strong> feature to keep announcements by the PR team visible during the stream.</p>
          <figure class="case-study-image">

          </figure>
        </div>

        <div class="phase-section">
          <h3>Phase 2: Increasing Engagement</h3>
          <p>To increase engagement, we added a <strong>trivia feature</strong>, where questions pop on screen and whoever answers correctly gets vouchers. We also added a close icon for trivia, as we don't want to force users to play — they came to watch the stream.</p>
          <figure class="case-study-image">
            <img src="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:2000/1*dHf6Y9E6gMvQVjmHbm4q7A.png" alt="Trivia feature design">
            <figcaption>Trivia feature</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>If the user is collecting promo codes or buying clothes, we show a small floating button for the trivia instead of the full pop-up, to not distract users from their task.</p>
          <p>We added a <strong>floating button</strong> to open a section showing multiple promo codes available during the stream, which can be collected easily.</p>

          </figure>
        </div>

        <h2>Next Steps</h2>
        <p>We will monitor the average user time on live stream and drop-off rate and compare it with the existing data.</p>
