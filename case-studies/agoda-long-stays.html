      <div class="case-study-content">
        <p>Agoda, a leading online platform for accommodations worldwide, identified the potential for growth in long-stays post-pandemic as more people adopt remote work, look for ways to relax and de-stress, and want to experience new places.</p>

        <h2>Research</h2>
        <p>To confirm the trend and the reasons for longer stays, we conducted a survey among Agoda users. The following are the most common responses from the multiple-choice question in the survey:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Remote work:</strong> More people are working remotely, which means they need accommodations that are more like homes than hotels.</li>
          <li><strong>Slower travel:</strong> People are looking for ways to relax and de-stress while traveling, and long-stays allow them to do that.</li>
          <li><strong>Change of scenery:</strong> People are looking for new places to experience after being cooped up at home for so long.</li>
          <li><strong>Affordability:</strong> Many hotels now offer discounts for longer stays, making them more affordable for travelers.</li>
          <li><strong>Convenience:</strong> Hotels offer a variety of amenities and services that can make traveling more convenient, such as laundry facilities, on-site restaurants, and fitness centers.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>The Problem</h2>
        <p><strong>How might we increase bookings for long-stays by making it easy for users to find and book discounted rates on our Android, iOS, and web interface?</strong></p>

        <h3>Long stay users</h3>
        <p>Long-stay users are people who plan to stay in one place for an extended period of time. They may be looking for a more affordable and convenient alternative to traditional hotels, or they may want to have their own space and amenities. Some examples include remote workers, digital nomads, travelers on a budget, and travelers looking for a change of scenery.</p>

        <h2>Defining the Goals</h2>
        <p>We identified the following goals for our long-stay discount campaign:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Increase user awareness of long-stay discounts.</li>
          <li>Simplify the process of finding and comparing long-stay deals.</li>
          <li>Promote user adoption, engagement, and retention.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>To achieve these goals, we decided to use the user awareness model, which has three steps:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Awareness:</strong> Users are introduced to the product or service, highlighting its features and benefits.</li>
          <li><strong>Nudge:</strong> Users are gently encouraged to engage with the product, through reminders and personalized suggestions.</li>
          <li><strong>Education:</strong> Users receive comprehensive education and support to enhance their understanding and competence.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Jobs to be done</h2>
        <p>We also used Jobs-to-be-done (JTBD), which is a framework that helps understand why people "hire" a product or service to get a job done. Our researcher helped us ask these questions through a survey:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Find and book long-stay accommodations at a discounted rate.</strong> Users want to find a good deal on a place to stay for an extended period of time.</li>
          <li><strong>Easily compare and choose long-stay deals.</strong> Users want to be able to compare different long-stay deals quickly and easily.</li>
          <li><strong>Feel confident about their booking decision.</strong> Users want to feel confident that they are making the right choice when booking a long-stay accommodation.</li>
          <li><strong>Easily extend their stay.</strong> Users want to be able to extend their stay without any hassle.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Designing the Solution</h2>
        <p>Our team at Agoda developed a user-focused solution to improve the long-stay booking experience on our platforms. We divided the UX design into three phases, each with a specific focus:</p>

          <figcaption>Design for all platforms</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <div class="phase-section">
          <h3>Phase 1: Awareness</h3>
          <p>The objective of this phase was to enhance user awareness of discounts for extended stays. To achieve this, we strategically placed "Weekly discount" badges next to the prices on the search results page, property details page, and price breakdown. This makes the users identify the discounts and decide to book the hotel.</p>

          </figure>
          <p><strong>Result:</strong> As a result of this phase, we saw a <strong>10% increase in bookings</strong>.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="phase-section">
          <h3>Phase 2: Nudge</h3>
          <p>We made incremental updates to improve the nudge banner, testing its potential before investing more development effort. The goal was to nudge users to extend their stay by showing them the financial benefits. We created targeted banners for users considering a six-day booking, highlighting discounts for adding an extra day.</p>

          </figure>
          <p><strong>Result:</strong> As a result of this phase, we saw an <strong>increase in the average length of stay by 1.6 days</strong>.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="phase-section">
          <h3>Phase 3: Education</h3>
          <p>The goal of this phase was to help users understand the benefits of longer stays. We created visually appealing banners with information on long-stay discounts, which increased proportionally to the length of stay booked by users.</p>
          <figure class="case-study-image">

            <figcaption>Banner with benefits</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p><strong>Result:</strong> As a result of this phase, we saw a <strong>decrease in the number of cancellations</strong>.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="results-section">
          <h3>Results & Impact</h3>
          <p>Through the use of badges, banners, progress bars, and visually appealing banners, Agoda was able to increase user awareness and encourage longer stays, resulting in <strong>over 2000 additional bookings per day</strong> across mobile apps and web.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Learning & Future Steps</h2>
        <p>Agoda's success in improving the user experience for long stays highlights the importance of focusing on user needs in the travel industry. By iterating on designs based on data and analytics leads to higher conversion.</p>
        <p>Going forward, Agoda will continue to monitor data and analytics to identify new opportunities.</p>
